# Conditionally conjugate variational Bayes in logistic models


This repository is associated with the paper [Durante and Rigon (2017). *Conditionally conjugate variational Bayes in logistic models*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06999), and aims at providing detailed materials to fully reproduce the analyses in the paper. 

The core functions of our implementations are made available in the file [`functions.R`](https://github.com/tommasorigon/logisticVB/blob/master/logistic.R), which can be downloaded from this repository, whereas a tutorial to fully reproduce our results is available in [`vb_logistic_tutorial.md`](https://github.com/tommasorigon/logisticVB/blob/master/vb_logistic_tutorial.md), which can be downloaded from this repository as well.
